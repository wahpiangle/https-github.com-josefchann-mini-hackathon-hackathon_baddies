Hereâ€™s a more polished and structured version for your `README.md` that provides clear instructions on running the FastAPI server and testing the API:

## How to Run the FastAPI Server and Test the API

### Step 1: Run the FastAPI Server

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uvicorn pipeline:app --reload
```

This command will:

- Launch the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Enable **hot reloading**, so the server will restart automatically when you make changes to your code.

### Step 2: Download Postman to Test the API

You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to easily test the API endpoints.

1. Download and install Postman.
2. Create a new request in Postman, choose the appropriate HTTP method (e.g., `POST`), and enter your API endpoint URL.
3. Provide the necessary input data (e.g., JSON payload that you can find in spellingCheckerSample.txt) and hit **Send**.
4. Review the API response directly within Postman.

Alternatively, you can use FastAPI's built-in interactive docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to explore and test the API.
